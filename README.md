# Spot NFT Dapp!

Users can build their own pfp on a React Canvas using the traits they own. The Dapp has a Metamask login. Users can mix and match over several hundred traits to create a unique pfp. The dapp fetches the traits present in a user's wallet dynamically using Moralis, and allows the user to mint a PFP only if all the chosen traits are available in user's wallet. The Dapp also calls the smart contract on the blockchain to verify if the selected sequence of traits is unique, thus ensuring no 2 PFPs minted will ever look alike.
### Built with Moralis.
